Before submitting the project remember that we need to
disclose any use of generative AI in writing, developing,
coming up with, and editing the text and code in the 
project.

This disclosure statement should be added to both the
portfolio and codebase.

**The instructions regarding the disclosure statement:**

> " Dear students,
> 
> I am currently grading Assignment 5 and I see again 
> many students using generative AI (ANY! ChatGPT, 
> Copiliot, Grammarly, DeepL, Quillbot etc.) without 
> disclosing so. For now and the remaining documents you 
> have to include a disclosure statement of any use of 
> software during your writing or editing process of any 
> documents. This has to be included in Assignment 6 
> (please revise your document if you already submitted 
> the assignment) and the final portfolio.
> 
> The statement can be either:
> 
> This document was developed with the support of 
> generative AI tools (name the tools), which provided 
> assistance in writing, editing, and refining the 
> content, based on their knowledge and capabilities as 
> of April 2023.
> 
> OR
> 
> This document was developed without the support of 
> generative AI tools.
> 
> These statements are binding and it's your 
> responsibility to ensure truthful disclosure. "
  
  
> " One more thing:
> Dear students, please understand that its totally fine 
> to use generative AI to improve your text. But, I will 
> see if you use it and you disclose it.
> When you write emails with pretty bad English and then 
> have text like this in your assignment: "To guarantee 
> program uniformity across platforms, intelligent 
> systems provide cross-platform emulation", it is 
> obvious that you are using any kind of AI.
> Don't overdo it. Write text on your own and then maybe 
> improve it, but keep it simple. ChatGPT tends to write 
> very flowery, and this will not be good nor 
> believable. I will deduct points! "
